- Unit Testing: test individual function
- Integration Testing: test functions / modules working together

#### Testing Function
- Fail() / ErrorF(string): mark test as failed
- FailNow()/ / FatalF(string): mark test as failed, abort current test
- Logf(): equivalent to Printf, but only when test fails
